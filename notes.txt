1. IPv6 needs a bit more enhancement


1. JSON Escaping (Low Priority)
Impact: Malformed/malicious SNI could break downstream parsers
Likelihood: Very low (SNI validated by TLS servers)
Fix Needed: Only if feeding untrusted data to strict parsers

2. Buffer Size (Low Priority)
Impact: Truncates jumbo frames (>8KB packets)
Likelihood: Rare on standard networks
Better Value: 65535 for full MTU support

3. No Signal Handler (Low Priority)
Impact: Minimal (OS handles cleanup)
Professional Touch: Add for production deployments
